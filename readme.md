# KiCad Library Repository

**Maintainer**: Superchange001

This repository is a personal collection of KiCad library components, primarily maintained by Superchange001. Components are periodically added and pushed to GitHub. Typically, commit messages are used to indicate changes, often labeled as “Added component but not tested yet.” However, over time, it becomes challenging to track the status of components—specifically, whether they are tested and ready for use.

To provide a clearer overview, a change log is now included below, detailing recent additions and their testing status.
